          The HXI is built around five core factors that represent distinct aspects of the haptic experience: Autotelics, Realism, Harmony, Discord, Involvement. Each factor captures a dimension of how users perceive and evaluate haptic interactions, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the haptic experience.

                Autotelics is a distinct hedonic dimension, characterized as
                "the touch experience as an end in and of itself" as opposed to

                haptic stimuli alone, without considering its functional utility
                as in the system. In short, it means the haptic sensation itself

                Realism is the extent to which sensory stimuli could simulate or
                represent sensations that one would expect to encounter in

                Harmony emerges as a pivotal factor shaping the overall quality
                of sensory encounters. Within the context of haptic feedback,
                Harmony refers to the seamless integration of haptic sensations
                with other sensory modalities, resulting in a unified and
                cohesive multi-sensory experience. Previous research has also
                explored a similar concept known as congruence, described as the

                Discord represents the lack of harmony in haptic experiences. It
                refers to the jarring, unpleasant, or disjointed aspects of
                haptic feedback that detract from the overall sensory
                experience. Discord occurs when haptic sensations are poorly
                integrated with other sensory modalities or when they create a
                sense of disconnection or discomfort for the user. Discord is
                the negative counterpart to Harmony. Discord may be more
                immediately noticeable than Harmony, acting as a "hygiene"
                factor.

                Involvement refers to a psychological state characterized by
                heightened engagement, focus and attention, as a result of the
                haptic sensations. Close to what was originally termed
                "immersion" by Kim and Schneider, involvement primarily focuses
                on the level of engagement experienced by users. Involvement is
                closely related to immersion and often regarded as a precursor
                to it.

            Kim and Schneider defined and developed a theoritical model of HX.
            This model identified five experiential factors of Harmony,
            Expressivity, Autotelics, Immersion, and Realism. This model
            captured unique constructs and emphasis within haptic technology.

            Drawing insights from previous attempts, Shi and Schneider drafted
            new sets of items through theoretical construction, expert reviews,
            and cognitive interviews, and established and validated the HXI

              <b>HXI is designed to be broadly applicable across different haptic modalities</b>. While only three (vibrotactile, mid-air, force-feedback) are included in the initial validation study, the contensistency demontrated by HXI supports its diverse applicability. Nevertheless, for modalities not covered in the study, we recommend exercising caution and adhering to the complete form of the HXI and report reliability metrics, as well as other relevant measures, to further examine its suitability.
              <br/><br/>
              <b>HXI is intended for administration immediately or shortly after the haptic interaction</b>. In the initial validation study, the HXI was administered within 12 hours for online participants and immediately after the interaction for in-person participants. Prolonged recall periods may compromise the reliability of results from the HXI.

              This questionnaire is structured using a <b>7-point Likert scale</b>, where participants will indicate their level of agreement with each statement by selecting one of the following options: <i>Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Somewhat Disagree, Neither Agree, Nor Disagree, Somewhat Agree, Agree, Strongly Agree</i>. 
              <br /><br />
              The HXI items should be shown in shuffled <b>randomized order</b> when possible. We also recommend <b>explaining what 'haptic sensations' and 'others senses' mean</b> immediately before the HXI items. The explainings provided when validating are "<i>Haptic sensations: Anything that you feel with the sense of touch. It could be vibrations, force, temperature, pressure, or any other physical sensation. Other senses: Sensory modalities beyond touch, such as vision and hearing.</i>"
              <br><br>
              There have been cautions against doing so and study showed psychometric properties may change when only using a subset of the questionnaire. <b>We recommend using the complete standard form of the HXI if the situation allows</b>.

              <b>The seven options should be scored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree)</b>. We recommend against scoring items on a scale from -3 to 3, as a score of 0 does not correspond to a meaningful condition, which may lead to interpretive inconsistencies.
              <br /><br />
              To calculate a <b>factor score</b>, each individual's responses to the four items in each factorshould be averaged.
              <br />To calculate the overall <b>general score: reverse the score for Discord first</b>, then add it with other four factors scores. <br /><br />Thus, General Score = Autotelics + Involvement + Realism + Harmony + ( 8 − Discord )

              The HXI provides a standardized tool for evaluating haptic experiences and captures distinct important aspects of haptic interactions that shape HX. <br /><br />As a quantitative measurement, HXI can enable <b>comparisons across different variations or iterations of a product, as well as between different products</b>.
              <br /><br />
              It is important to note, though, that <b>haptic applications have different goals and contexts, and the relative importance of each factor may vary across each product</b>. This was also echoed in expert interviews. Depending on the context, not all factors are targeted equally. For example, a relaxation app may prioritize Autotelics, while haptic design for a game may prioritize Involvement.

              We <b>strongly encourage</b> future studies using HXI to report <b>Cronbach’s alpha (reliability) and how the HXI relates to other measurements</b> (e.g., other UX questionnaires, overall ratings,sychophysiological measures like electrodermal activity andeye-tracking data).
              <br /><br />
              This will help further establish the validity and reliability of the HXI, provide a more nuanced understanding of how it can be used in combination with other methods to provide a comprehensive evaluation of haptic experiences in haptic design process.
